This is the first version of this file. It might arrive other versions,
but we don´t know yet, so let's wait some time to really be sure about it.

So, we´re going to add some more chunks of text to this file, because we
have to make some changes to this file.

In this line we´re just doing some small talk, nothing important.

This new paragraph was made in the master branch of this file, we're just adding
some text to track version changes. In this one is just one of many more to come,
by the way, today is november 26th of 2022.

This change I made it in the hub not in personal computer.

So, we've made the change from a normal http to a ssh. This change
was made on december 1st, 2022.
